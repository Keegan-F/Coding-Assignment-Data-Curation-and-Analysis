# Coding-Assignment-Data-Curation-and-Analysis

The goal of this project is to determine if and what trends exists between the population and land areas of the largest cities in the United States by population, specifically regarding how much the populations of these cities changed between 2020 and 2022.

The license for the data used was an Open Database License (ODbL), but the license for this data after it was processed for this project is an MIT License.

Categorical (strings): City - a city in the United States
Numerical (int, float): Population (2022) - the population of a city in 2022, Population (2020) the population of a city in 2020, Change - the change in a city's population from 2020-2022, Land Area (sq mi) - the area that a city covers in square miles, Land Area (km2) - the area that a city covers in square kilometers, Population Density (sq mi) - the density of a city by its population in square miles, Population Density (km2) - the density of a city by its population in square kilometers

Some potential issues include the fact that the populations listed for 2022 are only estimates while the only data for land area and population density is from 2020.
